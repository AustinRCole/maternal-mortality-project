                        focused heatmap was

                        negative correlation as can be seen in heatmap 1. Thus, in heatmap 2 above the analyses indicate
                        that diabetes and premature death had the strongest positive correlations. Other important
                        correlations included positive relationships with physical inactivity, obesity, and low birth
                        weight. Interestingly, medicare coverage also had a moderately strong correlation with MMR. High
                        health status, which is the percentage of women who reported that their health is very good or
                        excellent, had the strongest negative correlation in addition to higher weighted sums of all
                        determinants and health outcomes from the national average. Dental visits also had a moderately
                        strong negative correlation with MMR.</div>

                    <div class="card-body">We used Linear regression analysis, which is supervised
                        machine learning, because MMR is a continuous outcome. All features except birth and
                        death were compared against MMR. R-squared for
                        all the features was 0.54, which suggests that together the features only
                        moderately predict the MMR outcome.
                        The training and the test scores for the linear regression
                        were 0.54 and 0.36, respectively, which are only moderate, and not particularly for
                        the test. To conclude,
                        the model is not strong or weak, and for this reason, predictions of MMR
                        with the selected features would be moderately confident.</div>

                <div class="card-body"> Further reduction in features resulted in a slightly lowered R-squared (0.43).
                    Using the features with the most positive and negative correlation
                    with MMR, as depicted in the figure above, it was determinded that the data
                    were non-linear. So, a polynomial regression was applied and the features were converted into
                    polynomial feature at degree 2. Plotting the actual MMR, the linear regression MMR and
                    polynomial fit MMR demonstrated that the polynomial regression modeled the MMR
                    relationship with the variables better than the linear regression model.

            <div class="card">
                <div class="card-body">The dataset was grouped by year and the average annual MMR was calculated for
                    2009 to 2019 and then used in the time-series forecast to calculate the average predicted rates. A
                    regression was performed by year and an R-squared of 0.74 was observed. Maternal mortality rate
                    predictions were then carried out for 2020 to 2030. Maternal mortality rates increased slowly from
                    2009 to 2019 and based on the forecast continue to increase at the same pace until 2030. <a

                        People 2030’s</a> goal for maternal mortality rate is to reduce it to 15.7
                    maternal deaths per 100,000
                    births, however our model suggests that it will actually increase by 25% to approximately 44.
                    Clearly, the forecast depends on the variables continuing their current trend for the next 10 years.
                    These can obviously change, and thus, alter the trajectory of the maternal mortality rates. If rates
                    of diabetes, which had the strongest correlation with MMR, were to decrease or even just maintained
                    due to effective interventions (e.g., change in dietary habits) then it is possible that the
                    forecast would not increase as much from 2020 to 2030. This also applies to changes in obesity
                    rates, physical inactivity, health status of women, and other factors like dental visits, all of
                    which could drastically impact MMR in the years to come.</div>
